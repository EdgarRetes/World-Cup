Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: My predictions were that while I
increased the number of matches, the variation of chance of winning decreases but I
takes more time and viceversa if I decrease the number of simulations. They weren't proved wrong.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: I think that 10,000 simulations
is enough because it is the point where the time starts to increase by more seconds while it gets
a lot of simulations that decrease the variation of the results
